Assignment2 Big-O Notation explanation.
The Mini-Max Sum runs at a big O time of O(n), as the for loop will iterate n times and every other process runs at constant O(1) time.
The Mars Exploration program runs at a big O time of O(n) as well, for the same reasons as the Mini-Max Sum.

Assignment 3 - Big-O Notation Explanation:
  The Mini-max Sum runs at a big O time of O(log_n), as we sort the collection arr, which is a process that takes O(logn) time. Therefore, the process will complete in a time that is locked at O(logn) as this is the most comlpex piece of mini-max. Spacewise, the function will have a complexity of 2n + 12 bits, as every int will take up 2 bits of storage, plus the 12 initial bits to store the list.
